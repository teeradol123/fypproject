20,25 October 2020,It’s okay.. starters were,"It’s okay.. starters were very tasty, mains were ok but overpriced for what they were, burger was tasty and I would say worth the price. Lobster was a bit underwhelming. Dessert was a very good cheesecake. A good selection of drinks but again expensive.Overall the restaurant is very nicely decorated with a good atmosphere and the staff are very good. In all I just felt it was very over rated and overpriced, not at all bad but there are much better places for the price.The rating is so low as when I got home I was very unwell, I can’t say for certain food poisoning but it’s most likely the food which caused mr to turn which was a shame."
