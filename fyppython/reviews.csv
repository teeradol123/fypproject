50,15 September 2021,Amazing experience all round,"Booked for 7:30pm on Monday 13th September, arrived slightly early but was seated promptly. Service was brilliant from the offset - I didnâ€™t get our waiters name but he was faultless. So friendly and accommodating. We ordered the Combo for Two and told him that we had never ordered lobster before, he gave us recommendations and showed us what to do with the lobster when it arrived. The combo arrived on two plates, already split for each person to enjoy. He also said that the lobster roll was his favourite, of which I would agree! It was all delicious though. Would highly recommend."

40,9 November 2020,Well done,"So visited burger and lobster for a meal in early October. during 20-pound meal deal for lobster, fries and salad. It was well worth the price and you need to make the reservation online . The usual price of the lobster set is 30 pounds plus tax would be higher."
